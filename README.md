# Adventure Time API

This project was forked from https://github.com/mathhomework/at_api. While the
initial effort was not maintained for long-term use, this fork is an attempt to
upgrade it to modern versions of Django, scrapy, celery, etc. and get it
running again in order to generate a demo project dataset.

The original project was unliscensed so I have reached out to the author,
Andrew, and will see about adding an open source liscense ASAP.
