        <h1>About this API</h1>
        <p>
            This API is a side project that was put online in July 2015. It is a work in progress.
            PROTIP: To view this API, if you haven't already, you should consider getting a plug-in that will allow you
            to read JSON in a readable format. If you're using Chrome, check out

        <h2>Oh my Glob!! What the stuff are you doing?</h2>
        <p>Making an API for my favorite show, Adventure Time! The data was collected from the <a href="https://adventuretime.wikia.com">Adventure Time Wikia Page</a> using the
        Python scraper, Scrapy. Scheduling for collecting new data that comes in with each new episode is done through Celery.
            Everything is packaged together into this lumpy lil web app through Django and Django Rest Framework.
            The rest of the details can be seen on our
            <a href="https://github.com/mathhomework/at_api">Github page</a>!
        </p>
        <h2>More Questions?</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this API, advice on how I can improve this API, or requests for additional data fields,
         totally send me a message! My email is andrewshum@alumni.ucsd.edu</p>
